# Update everything
sudo apt-get update
​
# Install python and pip, python-dev for building C extensions to Python (NECESSARY!)
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev
​
# Install Atlas (for fast matrix manipulations, a better BLAS library) and a fortran compiler (needed for Numpy install)
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran
​
# Make sure that Atlas is our default library for BLAS
# For each of these, choose option 1 (should be atlas) and press enter
# Explanation: libblas is the library that numpy looks for.  When you do sudo update-alternatives you link that library to the selection of your choice (atlas)
sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so # Choose option 1
sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3 # Choose option 1
​
# You need to do the same for LAPACK, but Atlas should be the only option so it should say you have no choice
sudo update-alternatives --config liblapack.so
sudo update-alternatives --config liblapack.so.3
​
# Install ipython if you want
sudo pip install ipython
​
# Install numpy and scipy (MUST USE PIP TO PICK UP ATLAS!!!)
sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install scipy
​
# Run this command to make sure your numpy configuration is correct, if it is, you should see the atlas libraries having entries in the printed results
python -c 'import numpy; numpy.show_config()'
​
# Install gensim in distributed mode (for parallel processing)
sudo pip install gensim[distributed]
​
# Set up Pyro which gensim uses for talking between processes (possibly on remote machines).  Gensim distributed installed Pyro, we just have to configure it.
